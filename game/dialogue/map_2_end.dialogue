You hunker down near a wood stove in the collapsed ruins of a cabin.
You wonder about the mud man and the young woman.
You didn't recognize them, but did they act like they knew you?
if Global.p_state["transponder"] and not Global.p_state["transponder_used"]

A transponder from a watcher must be very valuable. It would be foolish to offer it to a stranger.
Your thoughts become a tangle of how you might know the two as you drift to sleep.
