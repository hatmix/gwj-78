~ start
Ahead of you is a large compound surrounded by poles and covered with white netting. The tops of the poles have little circling metal parts, just like the watchers.
As you approach the people outside begin to gather, waving and shouting. More appear from inside buildings, many with weapons.
Some start running in your direction, shouting a name.
- Look behind you
- Look for routes to escape the mob
- Shout back at them
- Just keep going
